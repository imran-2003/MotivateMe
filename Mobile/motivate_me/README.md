# motivate_me

The mobile client application that makes use of the MotivationWeb web service was built using Flutter. This is my first Flutter project that I worked on my own having learnt it to a certain extent over a few weeks.

The fonts used are from Google Fonts:

The background image used in the application was obtained from Pexels.com:

The icon for the application was made using Adobe Express.
